## 1. Evaluation Frameworks by Company

### DoorDash - Three Management Pillars
All behavioral questions map to these three pillars:
1. **Business Outcome** - Driving results, execution, delivery
2. **Team** - People management, hiring, coaching, culture
3. **Engineering Excellence** - Technical standards, quality, innovation

**Values to demonstrate:**
- "Make room at the table" (inclusion, collaboration)
- "One percent better every day" (continuous improvement)
- Ownership and accountability

### Nubank - Culture Priorities
- Decision-making quality (data-driven)
- Collaboration and teamwork
- Handling disagreements constructively
- Diversity and inclusion values
- Curiosity and asking questions

### Wise - Values
- "No drama. Good karma" (constructive conflict)
- Ownership mentality (ideation → production → maintenance)
- Transparency and customer obsession
- Product mindset (WHY to build, not just HOW)

### QuintoAndar
- Customer-oriented culture
- Collaborative work environment
- Innovation and technology-first
- Already covered in [storytelling.md](../companies/quintoandar/storytelling.md)

## 3. STAR Story Mapping Matrix

### Existing Stories (from QA prep)

| Story | Summary | Pillar | Best for |
|-------|---------|--------|----------|
| **A Plataforma** | Built ML/data platform from scratch. 1→9 eng, 70K exec/day, 150 models, 5 platforms decommissioned | Engineering Excellence, Business Outcome | Technical leadership, system design, hands-on→management transition |
| **Expansão Global** | Convinced worldwide teams to migrate. Stakeholder management, cultural adaptation, hit all targets | Team, Business Outcome | Conflict/resistance, stakeholder management, leadership growth |
| **Recomendação (MBA/Zé)** | Built recommendation system using collaborative filtering. Theory + practical implementation | Engineering Excellence | Showing ML hands-on experience |

### Gap Stories to Develop (4 new stories needed)

| # | Theme | What to prepare | Maps to |
|---|-------|----------------|---------|
| **G1** | Underperformer | Specific example: identified root cause, set clear expectations, provided support, outcome (improved or exited) | DD Performance Mgmt |
| **G2** | Critical Hire | A hire that changed the team's trajectory. What you looked for, how you evaluated, impact after joining | DD Hiring, Team Building |
| **G3** | Failure/Recovery | Project that failed or was at serious risk. What went wrong, how you recovered, lessons learned | DD Delivery, all companies |
| **G4** | Cross-Functional Unblock | Removed a blocker that required working across teams/orgs. Politics, alignment, outcome | DD Business Outcome |

### Story → Company Mapping

| Story | DD Team Building | DD Delivery | Nubank | Wise |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|--------|------|
| Plataforma | ✓ (built team) | ✓ (delivered platform) | ✓ (data infra parallels) | ✓ (large system ownership) |
| Expansão | ✓ (stakeholder mgmt) | ✓ (hit migration targets) | ✓ (cross-team collab) | ✓ (product adoption) |
| Recomendação | | | | ✓ (product + eng) |
| G1: Underperformer | ✓ (perf mgmt) | | ✓ (people decisions) | ✓ (feedback) |
| G2: Critical Hire | ✓ (hiring) | | ✓ (team building) | |
| G3: Failure | ✓ (resilience) | ✓ (recovery) | ✓ (learning) | ✓ (pragmatism) |
| G4: Cross-Func | ✓ (leadership) | ✓ (unblock) | ✓ (collaboration) | ✓ (ownership) |

## 5. "Why Company?" Answer Skeletons

### DoorDash
> "Three things attract me. First, the **scale and complexity** of the three-sided marketplace - matching customers, merchants, and dashers in real-time is a fascinating engineering challenge. Second, the **culture of ownership** and '1% better every day' resonates with how I've always worked - building the ML platform, we were obsessed with continuous improvement. Third, the **EM role specifically** - I've spent years building platforms that empower engineers, and doing that at DoorDash's scale with its engineering challenges is exactly the kind of problem that motivates me."

### Nubank
> "I'm drawn to Nubank for the **technical ambition** - processing billions of events daily with an immutable, functional architecture is impressive engineering. The **data infrastructure challenges** at your scale (100TB daily, 1000+ microservices) are the exact problems I spent years solving. And the **engineering culture** - functional programming as a principle, not just a tool, plus the focus on simplicity and self-service platforms - aligns with how I think about platform engineering."

### Wise
> "What attracts me to Wise is the **mission-driven engineering**. 'Money without borders' is a real problem I've experienced personally. From a technical perspective, the challenges of building **financial systems at scale** - consistency guarantees, idempotency, multi-currency ledgers - are fascinating. And the **Staff Engineer role** expectations - owning both technical AND product roadmaps - matches how I've always worked: I don't just build what I'm told, I help decide what to build."

## 6. Delivery Tips

### STAR Timing
- **S (Situation)**: 20% (~30 sec) - Brief context, don't over-explain
- **T (Task)**: 10% (~15 sec) - YOUR specific responsibility
- **A (Action)**: 60% (~90 sec) - What YOU did (detail here!)
- **R (Result)**: 10% (~15 sec) - Quantifiable impact + lessons

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **"We did..."** → Say "I did..." (they want YOUR contribution)
- **Vague results** → Always have numbers (70K executions, 150 models, 600 people)
- **Too long** → 2-3 min per story max. If they want more, they'll ask
- **No learning** → Always end with what you learned or would do differently
- **Rehearsed script** → Know the KEY POINTS, not word-for-word

### Cultural Adaptation Notes

| Company | Style | Adapt |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **DoorDash** | Direct, results-oriented, ownership | Lead with impact numbers, show accountability |
| **Nubank** | Collaborative, curious, values-driven | Emphasize team decisions, learning, diversity |
| **Wise** | Pragmatic, no-drama, product-minded | Show simplicity preference, product judgment, customer focus |
| **QuintoAndar** | Innovative, collaborative, tech-forward | Connect to their stack, show enthusiasm for their problems |
